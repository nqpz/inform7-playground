"Cookie clickee" by "Niels G. W. Serup"

The Cookieverse is a room. "You're Cookie, a chocolate chip cookie living
peacefully in the Cookieverse.

There's not much to do here except wait around for fun things to happen."

Cookie is a person. The player is Cookie.

A click is a thing. The description of a click is "A virtual action."

Instead of waiting:
    say "What's that? Did someone give you something?";
    now Cookie carries a click

Test waiting with "wait / inventory / examine click"
