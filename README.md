# Inform 7 playground

This is where I play around with [Inform 7](https://inform7.com/).

Each subdirectory contains its own work-in-progress small game.

I also sometimes work on https://github.com/nqpz/kantinen2012 which may
end up as a proper game at some point.


## Subdirectories

- `the-board-room`: Closing a deal.
- `fail-the-job-interview`: An exercise in wasting someone's time on purpose.


## Building and running

First install [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and run `nix-shell`.

Then, in each subdirectory, run `make test`.

Please see the [Building and running section on
inform7-scaffolding](https://github.com/nqpz/inform7-scaffolding?tab=readme-ov-file#building-and-running)
for more options.
